 Module 11
 
 ## Overview
 The goal of the Module 11 Challenge was to create a website that displays a table where you can filter UFO sightings based on date, location, and shape of the UFO. This filter was updated in the parameters we put in place. 
 
 ## Results
 The challenge requested UFO sighting information for the date of 1/10/2010. To complete this search, I used the table we built, placed the date into the "Enter Date" field, and came up with the following results:

## Summary 
### One Drawback: 
In my opinion, the biggest drawback to our website is the lack of raw data, with only around 100 UFO sightings included in the dataset. This webpage would be more useful with more data included. 

### Two additional recommendations: 
The webpage could use some more work in the physical data field information, such as how "seconds" is mis-spelled for the sigting in San Jacinto, CA in the "Duration" column. Next, I would create a display that color codes the duration based on how long the UFO was claimed to be seen. Lastly, I would try to include a link to the photograph or video of the supposed UFO sighting as one of the columns.
